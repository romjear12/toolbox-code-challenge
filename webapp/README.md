# Getting Started with Code Challenge of Toolbox

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Wireframe reference: https://cs1.ssltrust.me/s/me4H6BJjtZAGvzn

## How it works

Simple UI to make a request to API REST running on Express.js (PORT 4000).
You have to write a text inside the input field and click on Send Button. It will send the text to the API and you will get the inverted text. You might send many request to the API and it will show like a list, newest first.

###Â Instructions

1. Run API project (folder above)
2. Install npm dependencies
   - npm install
3. Run React project (this folder)
   - npm start
4. Open your browser on http://localhost:3000

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`
